Djambi game with personal rules at 6 players, to develop a reinforcement learing strategy.

For now, it plays randomly.

Runs on python.10.0 with a single script board.py. (non dockeris√©e car interface graphique)

How to install:
I used python.3.10.13. (for ex, use miniconda, and install an env with 3.10.13)
Then install pango and cairo ('brew install cairo pango' on macos/apt-get install 'cairo pango')
Then, in your virtual environment, install the requirements (you just need pygame, cairosvg, gym and tensorflow)
('pip install -r requirements.txt', or with environment.yml)
